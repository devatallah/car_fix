Hospital Management System (HMS)
Hospital Management System using MySQL, PhP, HTML5, CSS3, JS and Bootstrap.

We developed a cloud-based healthcare management system (HMS) that is designed to streamline and automate the management of healthcare services. HMS offers a user-friendly interface for administrators, doctors, and patients to efficiently manage and track healthcare activities. It facilitates patient registration, uploading medical records, appointment scheduling, and interactive communication tools. With features like unique patient ID generation, appointment conflict resolution, and secure cloud-based data management, HMS ensures scalability and accessibility for healthcare providers of all sizes.
